This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, React and Typescript and Material UI.

This is experimental repo to try GraphQL and maybe by that fly to js-weekend by Kiwi.com

Project is still missing form validation and proper messaging to user in case of errors (and after issues with data fetching).

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>


`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>

`yarn deploy`

Deploy to `homepage` set in package.json
Add deploy steps see https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages
